I have been using JavaScript for quite some time. Recently I feel like I need to re-learn it more carefully. I found (this tutorial)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide] from Mozilla Development Netowrk are very useful. I would like to take some notes while reading it.

### Javascript Object

- Any JavaScript function can be used as a constructor. You use the new operator with a constructor function to create a new object.
